# house-price-prediction
Thousands of houses are sold every day. There are some questions every buyer asks himself like: What
is the actual price that this house deserves? Am I paying a fair price? In this project, a machine learning
model is proposed to predict a house price based on data related to the house (its size, the year it was
built in, etc.). During the development and evaluation of the model, I have demonstrated the code used
for each step followed by its output.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges to predict the final price of each home. 
The task is to build a Creative feature engineering and to analyze and compare modelâ€™s performance in order to choose the best model
